# Rollups

**MOTIVATION**: Most layer 2 solutions maintain a security model that depends on liveness assumptions `=>` vulnerable to mass exit issues `&&` a bad operator can cause liveness to fail

### Philosophy

`Trustless ~= non-custodial`; an optimally trustless but permissioned L2 is better than a permissionless L2 where coins can be stolen or destroyed
