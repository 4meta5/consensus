# NPoS

**[NPoS Electon Problem](http://research.web3.foundation/en/latest/polkadot/NPoS/1.%20Overview/)**

Unlike other PoS-based projects where validators are weighted by stake, Polkadot gives elected validators equal voting power in the consensus protocol
* `\therefore` nominators' stake should be distributed among the elected validators as evenly as possible

**History of Phragmen**
* *motivation*: election methods tend to give all the seats to the most popular political party
* *solution*: algorithm to designate each party a certain number of seats proportional to the votes given to them (gives more representation to minorities)
* **proportionally justified representation**

This implies that the level of security for an election corresponds to the *minimum amount of backing of any elected validator*.
