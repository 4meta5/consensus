EIP-1559 proposes a `BASEFEE` that automatically adjusts in a predictable way based on network congestion.

*When the network is at >50% capacity, the BASEFEE goes up. And when capacity is at <50%, the BASEFEE goes down slightly. You can predict the maximum amount the BASEFEE could change from block to block. Therefore, your wallet can be set to pay the BASEFEE along with a tip for the miner (you can choose the tip amount).*

Moreover `=>` When you pay gas fees under EIP-1559, you burn a small amount of ETH, removing it from the ecosystem.
