# Tradeoffs

## Scalability Trilemma
* scalability vs security vs decentralization

### Zamfir's Triangle

Consensus protocols that only create finalized blocks have low latency with variable overhead and node scalability.

Traditional blockchain protocols have probabilistic finality, but arbitrarily high number of consensus-forming nodes with the same low protocol overhead i.e. Nakamoto Consensus, PPC, NXT, Snow White, Ouroboros, etc.

## Zooko's Triangle
* decentralization vs privacy
* also, privacy and usability

## Other Tradeoffs

In proof of stake, fundamental tradeoff between economic security and decentralization
