# Optimizing Rust Code

> take out stuff my rust-playground as well...

**I would like to do a post on Rust optimizations** 
* using `troubles.md` and the notes from Maciej
* ask Maciej if he can make a list of all the optimizations he's discovered that he commonly comes across
    * if he makes the list, I can do a write up on them
    * example: `format!` macro to `write!` macro to make it so that you don't have to create new objects in the heap
* **Rust high performance** book
